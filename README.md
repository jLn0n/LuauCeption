# LuauCeption
Running Luau inside Luau. Inspired by [@Rerumu's LuauInLuau](https://gist.github.com/Rerumu/ecaf1de2f2b31d0fa91b9bac8e1e15d8).

## Notes
- This branch is only for self-development, changes here will not be pushed to the main repository.

## Testing
LuauCeption uses [lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) (runtime) and [frktest](https://github.com/itsfrank/frktest) (library). See ``src/tests`` to view the tests stuff.

To run tests, ensure you've initialized submodules (as the frktest library is imported using submodules) and simply run the ``run.luau`` script with lune.

The old testing script (``Test.luau``) at ``utils/_helpers`` is still available, however it won't be used or updated for newer work.

## Special thanks
